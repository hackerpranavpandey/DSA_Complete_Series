// So, what we can observe from the above examples is that on the perimeter 
// of the square, there is an integer no. N which decreases by 1 as we move inside
//  the square level-wise. Since this cannot be printed directly, we print it in reverse 
// fashion (0â€™s at the border of the square, then 1 in the inner perimeter, then 2, and so on ) 
// and then subtract the whole pattern by N at the end which just makes the outermost perimeter 
// filled with the number N, inner perimeter with N-1 and finally the centermost element with the integer 1.
// The outer and the inner loop will run for the same number of times ( since we have to print square) i.e, 
// 2*N-1 times and the inner loop would print the numbers based on the logic as described below ( for N = 4 ):
